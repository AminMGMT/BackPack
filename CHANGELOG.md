# Changelog

All notable changes to Backpack are documented here.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Full backup & restore.** Bundle every tunnel (with its token), the web-panel
  password, Telegram settings, TLS certificates, per-tunnel metadata and the
  auto-refresh schedule into a single portable `.tar.gz` — from the CLI
  (**Manage → Backup & Restore**) or the web panel (**Settings → Backup &
  restore**) — and restore it on any server. Restore re-registers and starts
  every tunnel, brings the panel back up, and restores the schedule. The archive
  extractor is hardened against path traversal, and the machine-specific
  `install_path` is never overwritten on the target host.

### Changed
- **Friendlier CLI.** The main menu now shows a short description beside each
  option, and the header shows the web-panel URL, login code, tunnel counts,
  auto-refresh status and the version at a glance.
- **Web panel starts on launch.** The panel is brought up as soon as the menu
  opens, instead of only after the first tunnel is created.

### Security
- **Tokens are no longer written to logs.** Invalid-token handshakes previously
  logged the token value (visible via `journalctl` and the panel log drawer);
  the value is now redacted on both the server and client sides.

### Notes
- No new dependencies — the binary still builds from the Go standard library
  plus the existing modules, so one-click updates keep working on restricted
  (e.g. Iran) networks.
